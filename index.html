	<h1>Gareth <small>The gentle git code review system</small></h1>
	<p>Gareth is a web based code review system intended to work with git repositories.</p>

		<h2>The git way <img alt="" src="/css/git-logo.png" width="25"></h2>
		<p>Doing things the way one usually uses git is one of Gareth's core focuses.</p>
		<p>We don't use any hacks like verbose non-standard push commands or custom commands necessary for installation.</p>
		<p>Our review strategy is based on the way public repos and pull requests work streamlined into a review system.</p>

		<h2>Development <i class="icon-pencil" style="vertical-align: middle;"></i></h2>
		<p>Gareth is currently under development and not ready for practical use yet.</p>
		<p>Feel free to fork our repo and help move the project forwards. Feel free to send pull requests until Gareth is mature enough for us to use ourself.</p>

		<p>Gareth is going to be a large project with many separate areas. If you're looking for something isolated from the rest of the system we need to have implemented you can look over our <a href="https://github.com/dantman/gareth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR-PROJECTS">CONTRIBUTOR-PROJECTS</a> for projects to work on.</p>
