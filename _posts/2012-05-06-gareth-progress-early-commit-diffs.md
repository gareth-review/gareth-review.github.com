The current part of Gareth I've been working on lately is the diff system. Namely diffs being displayed on commit pages. Frankly even given how good they look so far I'm still in the early stages of these, but here's a preview.

## Screenshots

<ul class="thumbnails" id="gallery" data-toggle="modal-gallery" data-target="#modal-gallery">
	<li class="span3">
		<div class="thumbnail">
			<a href="/screenshots/earlydiff-2012-05-06.png" title="Early diff" rel="gallery">
				<img alt="" src="/screenshot-thumbs/earlydiff-2012-05-06.png">
			</a>
			<div class="caption">
				<h5>Early diff</h5>
			</div>
		</div>
	</li>
</ul>
